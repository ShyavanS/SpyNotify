# SpyNotify
SpyNotify is an app made using Python that lets you know if your webcam is in use. This program was created as part of a grade 10 introductory business and entrepreneurial project. You may find this useful to idnetify if your webcam is on when you don't want it to be if the indicator light is not working.

The program is compatible with Windows MacOS and Linux and works by periodically trying to estabilsh a connection with the webcam and seeing if it is refused or not depending on if another application is using it. It runs in the background and on startup, but does not send or store any data.

The program was also intended to be used with SpyBlock Plus, a 3D printed webcam shutter also made for the project. This would be stuck to your webcam with double-sided tape and is available on Printables for download: https://www.printables.com/model/21364-spyblock-plus-a-webcam-shutter
